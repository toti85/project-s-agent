Hello {{Name}},

I noticed a few technical issues on {{website}} while conducting research for a case study on websites in the {{industry}} sector.

My analytics platform detected:
• {{specific_issue_1}} which may be impacting your SEO ranking
• {{specific_issue_2}} affecting page load speed on mobile devices
• {{specific_issue_3}} that could be hurting your conversion rate

I've prepared a brief complimentary audit showing these issues (attached) and would be happy to discuss how they can be fixed quickly.

My background: I'm a website optimization specialist with 10+ years of experience helping businesses like {{competitor}} and {{competitor}} improve their technical performance. My clients typically see a 30-40% improvement in key metrics within 30 days.

Best regards,
