2. Select the code you want to analyze (or entire file)
3. Click the "Analyze Code" button in the sidebar
4. Review the analysis in the output panel

**Example use cases:**
- Identifying code smells and anti-patterns
- Finding potential performance bottlenecks
- Understanding complex code structure

### Advanced Analysis Options

For more targeted analysis, you can use the command palette:

1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac)
2. Type "Project-S: Advanced Analysis"
3. Choose from options like:
   - Security analysis
   - Performance analysis
   - Architecture analysis
   - Dependency analysis

## Code Generation Features

Generate high-quality code snippets and complete functions with the code generation features.

### Basic Code Generation

**Purpose:** Generate code based on natural language descriptions or existing patterns.

**How to use:**
1. Place your cursor where you want to insert generated code
2. Click the "Generate Code" button in the sidebar
3. Describe what you want to generate in the input prompt
4. Review and accept the generated code

**Example use cases:**
- Creating boilerplate code
- Implementing interfaces
- Writing test cases
- Converting between programming languages

### Contextual Code Generation

The extension can understand your project context for smarter generation:

1. Select some existing code as context
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac)
3. Type "Project-S: Contextual Generate"
4. Describe what you want to generate in relation to the selected code

## Documentation Features

Automatically generate and maintain code documentation with these features.

### Code Documentation

**Purpose:** Create or update documentation for functions, classes, and modules.

**How to use:**
1. Select the code you want to document
2. Click the "Document Code" button in the sidebar
3. Documentation will be inserted as comments above the selected code

**Example use cases:**
- Adding JSDoc/PyDoc comments to functions
- Generating README files
- Creating API documentation

### Documentation Options

For more control over documentation style:

1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac)
2. Type "Project-S: Document Options"
3. Choose from options like:
   - Documentation style (JSDoc, PyDoc, etc.)
   - Detail level (brief, detailed, comprehensive)
   - Include examples (yes/no)

## Working with LangGraph Workflows

LangGraph workflows allow you to create complex multi-step AI operations on your code.

### Creating Workflows

**Purpose:** Define custom sequences of operations for your specific needs.

**How to use:**
1. Click the "+" button in the Workflows section header
2. Enter a name for the workflow
3. Select a workflow type or template
4. Configure the workflow nodes and connections
5. Save the workflow

**Example workflow types:**
- Code review workflow
- Refactoring workflow
- Bug fixing workflow
- Feature implementation workflow

### Executing Workflows

**Purpose:** Run your workflows on selected code or files.

**How to use:**
1. Find your workflow in the workflows list
2. Click the play button (â–¶) next to the workflow
3. If prompted, select code or files to process
4. Follow any interactive steps required by the workflow
5. Review the results

### Custom Workflow Development

For advanced users who want to create custom workflows:

1. Access the workflow editor through the command palette:
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac)
   - Type "Project-S: Edit Workflow"
2. Use the graphical editor to:
   - Add and connect nodes
   - Configure node parameters
   - Set input/output mappings
3. Test and refine your workflow
4. Share workflows with your team

## Real-time Collaboration

The Project-S extension supports real-time collaboration with others.

### Sharing Analysis Results

**Purpose:** Collaborate with team members on code analysis.

**How to use:**
1. Run an analysis on your code
2. In the output panel, click "Share Results"
3. Choose sharing options (team members, channels)
4. Add optional comments
5. Click "Share"

### Collaborative Workflows

**Purpose:** Work together with team members on complex tasks.

**How to use:**
1. Create or select a workflow
2. Click the "Collaborate" button
3. Invite team members
4. Assign steps to different team members
5. Track progress and communicate through the built-in chat

## Keyboard Shortcuts

For faster operation, use these keyboard shortcuts:

- `Ctrl+Alt+A` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Alt+A` (Mac): Analyze current file
- `Ctrl+Alt+G` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Alt+G` (Mac): Generate code at cursor
- `Ctrl+Alt+D` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Alt+D` (Mac): Document selected code
- `Ctrl+Alt+W` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Alt+W` (Mac): Show workflow panel
- `Ctrl+Alt+R` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Alt+R` (Mac): Run last workflow

You can customize these shortcuts in VSCode's keyboard shortcuts settings.

## Best Practices

To get the most out of the Project-S extension:

1. **Start small:** Begin with simple analyses and generations before moving to complex workflows
2. **Use context:** Select relevant code before running tools for better results
3. **Iterate:** Refine generated code and documentation rather than expecting perfect results immediately
4. **Combine tools:** Use analysis results to inform your code generation requests
5. **Save workflows:** Create and save workflows for repeated tasks
6. **Provide feedback:** Use the feedback mechanisms to help improve the AI models
