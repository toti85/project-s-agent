# Project-S System Architecture
==============================

## 🏗️ Overview

Project-S follows a modular, event-driven architecture designed for scalability, maintainability, and extensibility.

## 🔄 Event-Driven Architecture

The system uses an event bus for loose coupling between components:

```
User Input → CLI → Command Router → Core Handler → Tools → Response
     ↑                                ↓
Event Bus ←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←← Events
```

## 🛠️ Tool System

Extensible tool architecture with:
- Base tool interface
- Tool registry and discovery
- Security validation
- Performance monitoring

## 🔒 Security Model

Multi-layer security:
- Command validation and filtering
- Tool permission system
- Audit logging
- Input sanitization
