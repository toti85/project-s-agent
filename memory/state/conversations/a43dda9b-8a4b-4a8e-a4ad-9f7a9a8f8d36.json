    "content": "Recursion in programming is the concept of a function calling itself in order to solve a problem. It is a way of designing solutions for problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable pieces.\n\nHere is an example of recursion in programming:\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n-1)\n\nprint(factorial(5)) # Outputs 120\n```\n\nIn this example, the `factorial()` function calculates the factorial of a given number `n`. It calls itself with a smaller value each time until `n` becomes 0. At that point, it returns 1 to stop the recursion. Then, the recursive calls start returning values back up the chain until the final result is computed. \n\nRecursion can be a powerful and elegant way to solve certain types of problems, but it can also be prone to stack overflow errors if used carelessly. It is important to have a clear base case and make sure that the recursive call eventually reaches this base case to stop the recursion.",
